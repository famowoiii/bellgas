## 🛠️ Technical Improvements Made

### JavaScript Optimization:
```javascript
// BEFORE (causing errors):
<script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com" defer></script>
<script defer src="axios/dist/axios.min.js"></script>
<script defer src="alpinejs@3.x.x/dist/cdn.min.js"></script>

// AFTER (working properly):
<script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>
<script src="axios/dist/axios.min.js"></script>
<script defer src="alpinejs@3.x.x/dist/cdn.min.js"></script>
```

### Error Prevention:
```javascript
// Added dependency checking
async init() {
    if (typeof axios === 'undefined') {
        setTimeout(() => this.init(), 100);
        return;
    }
    // Continue with initialization
}
```
